# did:web AnonCreds Method

This repository cointains the [specification](./spec.md) (currently under development) for AnonCreds object identification and resolution using did:web.

# Implementations

Currently there is an implementation of this specification for [Aries Framework JavaScript](https://github.com/2060-io/aries-javascript-didweb-anoncreds). This registry module allows a client to access and an issuer to generate a suitable ID for AnonCreds objects.
